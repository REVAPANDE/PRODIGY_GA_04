# üß† Task 4: Image-to-Image Translation with Pix2Pix (cGAN)

This project demonstrates how **Pix2Pix**, a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN), performs **image-to-image translation** ‚Äî a powerful technique that converts structured input images (like edges or sketches) into realistic outputs (like real shoes, facades, etc.).

## üßæ What is Pix2Pix?

Pix2Pix is a deep learning model that learns to map input images to output images. It is particularly useful for tasks such as:
- Turning edge sketches into real images
- Converting black-and-white images to color
- Translating day-to-night photos, and more.

It uses two components:
- A **Generator**: Learns to create realistic images from input
- A **Discriminator**: Learns to distinguish real images from fake ones

They are trained together in a GAN framework.

## üõ† What I Did in This Project

Due to resource limitations on Colab and the heavy compute requirements of Pix2Pix:

- I used a **preformatted input image** that simulates the Pix2Pix dataset structure (edges on the left, real photo on the right).
- I split this image into:
  - **Input image**: The edge sketch
  - **Target image**: The real counterpart (not used in inference here)
- I **simulated Pix2Pix translation** by applying a basic image operation (`invert`) to create an output image from the edge sketch.

| Input (Edge Image) | Simulated Output |
|--------------------|------------------|
| ![Input](sample_pix2pix_input.jpg) | ![Output](generated_pix2pix_output.jpg) |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è *Note: Output is simulated due to hardware constraints. Actual Pix2Pix training or pretrained inference was not feasible within Colab's limits.*
